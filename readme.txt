After some reverse on the asm,
you would find this regex pattern "@15616\nD=M\n@.*\nM=D\n@9\nD=A\n" means the correctness of the input flag from 5339 lines.
And "@15616\nD=M\+1\n@.*\nM=D\+1" means the input string.
And "(MSGVJFPD)" would be the final check.
Use some regex replace to become a python z3 solver script.
And you would get the flag: Balsn{U_r_C0Mp1LeR_h4cKer}
